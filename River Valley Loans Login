Credit insurance is almost always more expensive than other types of insurance such as term life insurance. The amount you’ll pay will depend on factors like loan or credit type, the amount of debt that will be protected and the type of insurance policy and lender you choose.

The US Government Accountability Office found that debt protection insurance fees ranged from $0.85 to $1.35 per month for debt insurance for credit cards. Although it doesn’t look like much, the cost adds up for high-balance loan amounts.
