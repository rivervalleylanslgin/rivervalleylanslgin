According to Wisconsinâ€™s Department of Financial Institutions, the credit life insurance premium on a $15,000 car loan with a four-year term at 9% costs $301. For credit disability insurance, the cost can climb higher. It found that alternative protections, like term life insurance have a lower premium than getting a credit insurance policy upon signing for a loan.

Whether or not your loan or credit is open like a credit card or closed like an installment loan can also play a role in the cost of credit insurance.
